# Nice_HW - Task Suggestion System

## Overview
It is a REST API that suggests tasks based on user input. It supports two modes:
- **Dictionary-based (`suggest`)**: Matches phrases to tasks using a dictionary.
- **Classifier-based (`classifier`)**: Uses a machine learning model (logistic regression) to predict tasks.

"Developers" users (specific IDs in resources/devUsers) can update the dictionary dynamically using special commands.

---

## Key Features

- Suggest tasks for user utterances.
- Two modes: dictionary and classifier.
